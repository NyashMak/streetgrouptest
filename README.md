## Nyasha Makwavarara :- Street Group Test

Get Started

1. To run this app you will need to have Laravel installed on your PC/Mac

2. Run composer install


Notes

- I chose Laravel because overtime I have seen working with spreadsheets a lot more effiecient when you use the Laravel Excel package. The documentation is also well written.

- When importing large spreadsheet files, I found it easier to set chuck sizes or use queues to process the data using the same package. 

- MVC frameworks make it easier to debug code due to the way they are structed and Laravel is no exception.
